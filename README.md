# Guide to Approaching Data Migration for Dynamics 365

Preparing for a Dynamics 365 migration project involves understanding the technical aspects of Dynamics 365 and data architecture, as well as the specific challenges and considerations related to data migration. Here are key areas to focus on:

### 1. Understand Dynamics 365
- **Overview**: Familiarise yourself with Dynamics 365's components, such as CRM, ERP, and other modules.  You should know what Dynamics 365 modules are configured in the Target state and how much customisation.
- **Integration**: Learn how Dynamics 365 integrates with other Microsoft products (like Power BI, Azure, SharePoint) and third-party tools.
      - SSIS : Ideal for complex transformations which are typically on premises to cloud.  Data is extracted from source systems via standard or third party connectors like CData.  Data is transformed to match the schema and format required for Dynamics 365. These transformations could include data cleansing, de-deuplication or data type conversions. Data is then Loaded into Dynamics 365 Tables.
      - Data Factory : Ideal for Cloud based large scale migrations.  Like SSIS, aata is extracted from source systems via standard connectors but third party connectors can be supported usually through the ODBC connector with third party drivers running on a virtual machine.  Data is transformed to match the schema and format required for Dynamics 365 using Data Factory Data Flows, Azure Functions or Python Notebooks. These transformations could include data cleansing, de-deuplication or data type conversions. Data is then Loaded into Dynamics 365 Tables.
      - Dynamics 365 Migration Tool : Ideal for Dynamics to Dynamics migrations and offers a straight forward migration tool and approach.  This tool is designed to migrate from older Dynamics systems.  Data is extracted from the older Dynamics system with pre-designed mapping from old to new Dynamics.  Entity Mapping between source and target defines the transformations required for Dynamics 365.   
- **Customisation**: Understand how to customise Dynamics 365 to meet specific business needs. Customisations can include User Interface, Business Process, Data Model, Security, Integration or other Custom development.  Before you customise consider :
       - Understand Business Requirements: Thoroughly understand the business processes and requirements and don't customise anything that is not mature and well understood.
       - Avoid Over-Customisation: Customisation should be the exception not the rule.  Customise only what is necessary to fulfill business needs that can't have a work around implemented using built-in standard Dynamics functionality. Over-customisation can complicate system upgrades and maintenance.
       - Documentation and Training: Document customisations and provide adequate training to users.  Use a github page if you don't have any other solution and use tools like Scribe to document screens and export to github markup.
       - Testing: Rigorously test customisations in a test environment before deploying them to production.   Utilise requirements traceability matrix so you can align multiple test id's to a single business requirement id.
       - Change Management: Manage changes carefully, especially in large organizations, to ensure a smooth transition.  Setup Lifecycle services well so that change management is controlled.

### 2. Data Migration Fundamentals
- **Migration Process**: Understand the stages of data migration: Assessment, Planning, Execution, Testing, and Deployment.
  - Second level item
     - Third level item
  - Another first level item

- **Tools and Techniques**: Be familiar with tools used for Dynamics 365 data migration (like SQL Server Integration Services, Azure Data Factory, or Dynamics 365 Data Migration Tool).
- **Data Quality**: Know how to handle data cleaning, deduplication, and validation during migration.

### 3. Data Architecture Principles
- **Data Modeling**: Be ready to discuss your experience with data modeling, particularly in the context of CRM or ERP systems.
- **Database Management**: Understand how to manage large databases, including performance tuning and optimization.
- **Security and Compliance**: Be aware of data security, privacy laws (like GDPR), and compliance requirements.

### 4. Project Management
- **Methodologies**: Be conversant with Agile, Scrum, or other project management methodologies.
- **Risk Management**: Know how to identify and mitigate risks in a migration project.
- **Stakeholder Management**: Be prepared to discuss how you communicate and work with different stakeholders.

### 5. Problem-solving and Experience
- **Case Studies**: Think of specific examples from your past work where you solved complex data architecture problems or led successful migration projects.
- **Challenges**: Be ready to discuss challenges you might anticipate in a Dynamics 365 migration and how you would address them.

### 6. Soft Skills
- **Communication**: Ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Teamwork**: Experience working in collaborative environments.
- **Adaptability**: Show that you are adaptable to changing technologies and project requirements.

### 7. Stay Updated and Do Your Research
- **Latest Trends**: Stay updated on the latest trends and updates in Dynamics 365.
- **Company Research**: Understand the specific needs and challenges of the company you are interviewing with. Tailor your responses to show how you can meet their specific needs.

### Practice and Preparation
- **Mock Interviews**: Conduct mock interviews with a friend or mentor. Focus on articulating your thoughts clearly and confidently.
- **Questions Preparation**: Prepare answers for common interview questions and have questions ready to ask the interviewer about the company and project.

### On the Day of the Interview
- Dress professionally and arrive early.
- Bring copies of your resume and a list of references.
- Show enthusiasm and curiosity about the role and the company.

Remember, the key to a successful interview is not just technical know-how but also demonstrating that you understand the business implications of the project and can communicate effectively with a range of stakeholders.
